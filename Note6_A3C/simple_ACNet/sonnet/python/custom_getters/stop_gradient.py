def stop_gradient(getter, *args, **kwargs):
  """Custom getter which prevents variables being optimized.

  Usage like:

    with tf.variable_scope("", custom_getter=snt.custom_getters.stop_gradient):
        net = snt.Linear(num_hidden)(net)

  will result in the gradient with respect to the variables in the linear
  module being `None`. By default, the variables will still be in the trainable
  variables collection.

  When used with a Sonnet module, the module must be constructed inside the
  variable scope with the custom getter. Just building the module inside said
  variable scope will not use the custom getter.

  Args:
    getter: The true getter to call.
    *args: Arguments, in the same format as tf.get_variable.
    **kwargs: Keyword arguments, in the same format as tf.get_variable.

  Returns:
    The return value of `getter(*args, **kwargs)` with a tf.stop_gradient.
