  """Builds a module out of a sequence of callables.

  Note that `Sequential` is limited in the range of possible architectures
  it can handle. This is a deliberate design decision; `Sequential` is only
  meant to be used for the simple case of fusing together modules/ops where
  the input of a particular module/op is the output of the previous one. Another
  restriction is that it is not possible to have extra arguments in the `_build`
  method that are passed to the constituents of the module - for example,
  if there is a `BatchNorm` module in `Sequential` and the user wishes to switch
  the `is_training` flag. If this is the desired use case, the recommended
  solution is to use `snt.Module` to wrap a custom function, as shown in the
  following example:
