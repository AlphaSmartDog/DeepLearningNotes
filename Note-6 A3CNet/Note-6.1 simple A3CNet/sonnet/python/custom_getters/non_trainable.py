def non_trainable(getter, *args, **kwargs):
  """Custom getter which makes a variable non-trainable.

  Usage like:

    with tf.variable_scope("", custom_getter=snt.custom_getters.non_trainable):
        net = snt.Linear(num_hidden)(net)

  will result in the variables inside the linear having `trainable=False`, i.e.
  won't be added to tf.trainable_variables() and thus won't be optimized.

  Warning: If `reuse=True` and the variable has previously been created in
  the same graph with `trainable=True`, this custom getter will do
  nothing. Similarly if the variable is reused after being created by this
  custom getter it will still be non-trainable, even if `trainable=True`.

  When used with a Sonnet module, the module must be constructed inside the
  variable scope with the custom getter. Just building the module inside said
  variable scope will not use the custom getter.

  Args:
    getter: The true getter to call.
    *args: Arguments, in the same format as tf.get_variable.
    **kwargs: Keyword arguments, in the same format as tf.get_variable.

  Returns:
    The return value of `getter(*args, **kwargs)` except with `trainable=False`
    enforced.

  kwargs["trainable"] = False
  return getter(*args, **kwargs)
